### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a software developer with extensive experience in various technologies, including TypeScript, Node.js, and SQL. I have a solid foundation in working with database systems and a passion for learning and expanding my technical skills. I am currently seeking opportunities to stabilize and deepen my existing knowledge in a dynamic and innovative environment, where I can contribute to the development of high-quality software.
